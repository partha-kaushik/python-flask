# Plotly DevOps Homework Assignment

## Goal

Your goal is to show how you would build, and deploy the included application
using Kubernetes .

## Assignment

Your task is to accomplish the following:

- Build a small Kubernetes test cluster either locally or in the cloud. A single
  node is fine. Feel free to use Terraform with a cloud provider or an
  all-in-one tool for a local cluster (minikube, microk8s, or k3d)
- Build Docker file for the sample application
- Build a deployment mechanism for the app
- Describe a plan for continuous delivery with the specific tools/vendors you'd
  look at and your evaluation criteria for them

## Deliverables

We'd like to see a repo with the following:

- A Dockerfile for the application
- Repeatable deployment mechanism for the application
- A README with the set-up process so we can run it ourselves
- A text file with a BRIEF write-up about the following:
  - Continuous Delivery plan for the app ecosystem
  
## Notes

- Please do not fork or submit a PR to this repo
- If you get stuck or need more information, please reach out for clarity
- Have fun!
